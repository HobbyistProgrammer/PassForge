TODO LIST:
    - TODO 1: This application will create a whole new file for db if it does not currently exist. What would happen if user has a premade file named passforge.db?
    - TODO 2: Add functionality to 'Enchant' passwords to keep them more protected (i.e. PIN's, or extra SALT + HASH password).

    - TODO *w/e*: Clean up code (lots of unnecessary lines).
    - TODO *w/e*: Add documentation and descriptions for each method.
    - TODO *w/e*: Think about renaming some classes (even I am confused on the naming).

TODO *Later Possible Features*:
    - Implement cloud saving (will save each update on passwords in the cloud).
    - UI/UX overhaul.
